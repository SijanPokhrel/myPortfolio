                    <p>The iris of the eye teaches us adaptability. Just as the iris adjusts the pupil to regulate the
                        amount of light entering the eye, we must learn to adapt to life’s changing circumstances. In
                        bright moments, we should embrace the abundance of opportunities and clarity, and in darkness,
                        we need to focus, stay calm, and find our way.
                        <br>
                        The unique patterns of the iris also remind us of individuality—no two people see the world
                        exactly the same way. This uniqueness highlights the importance of understanding and respecting
                        different perspectives. Like the iris works in harmony with the rest of the eye, life is about
                        balance, adjusting to challenges while staying grounded in who we are.
