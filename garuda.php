                    <p>Garuda, in Hindu mythology, it is the bird and the mount (vahana) of the god Vishnu. The
                        mythological account of Garuda's birth in the Mahabharata identifies him as the younger brother
                        of Aruna, the charioteer (sarathi) of the sun god, Surya. Garuda's mother, Vinata was tricked
                        into becoming the slave of her sister and co-wife, Kadru; mother of the nagas (serpents). The
                        lasting hatred between the Garuda and the serpents is attributed to this. The nagas agreed to
                        release Vinata if Garuda could obtain for them a drink of the elixir of immortality, the amrita.
                        Garuda performed that feat, thus giving the snakes the ability to scrap off their old skins, and
                        on his way back from the heavens, he met Vishnu and agreed to serve him as his vehicle and also
                        as his symbol. Ps. The above story is based on my self research and may varies!<br>
